What is it?
-----------
An on-screen keyboard for gamepads.

Why did you make it?
--------------------
I often use my controller to navigate around the desktop and it
pains me to have to go to the keyboard to type stuff. After
searching the web for an "on-screen keyboard for gamepads", I
couldn't find one and Windows' built in OSK seems to be hard to
use along with gamepads. Thus, GameBoard is made.

Your code is a mess and is un-optimized.
----------------------------------------
I'm a bad programmer. And this is my very first Java project
that is actually usable.

What did you use to develop this?
---------------------------------
Java is the underlying technology used in this project and I
used the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.

Will this work on Linux/OSX?
----------------------------
I haven't tried that yet. But I included the necessary library
files on the distribution anyway so feel free to try it out
on your platform.
